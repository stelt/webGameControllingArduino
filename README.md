# Sudoku3D (virtual and physical)

From <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/29/3d/8d/293d8d80dd44ca8d8f4acc24639d0e40--sudoku-kinder-sudoku-for-kids.jpg">to <img src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/R3wAAOSwvuhbmLbn/s-l300.jpg">

I wonder
- if it's fun to play
- how people cooperate
- if people figure out the logic if you don't tell 'm it's a representation of Sudoku

plus: Sudoku is a nice problem to practice parallel programming/logic on, and this cube a nice thing to shape the rather low-level circuitry around.
